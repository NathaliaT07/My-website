            <p>Hi my name is Nathalia! I am a highschool student at KIPP Austin Collegiate going into my junior year</p>

            <h3>Skills, Interests and Experience</h3>
            <p>Some of my skills include some basic knowledge of programming languages like HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Java. 
                In addition to this I know how to use the program Onshape used for CAD modeling. I am interested in learning more 
                about the coding languages I have already been introduced to and also knew ones. I'm also interested in actual languages
                as I'm currently trying to learn French. Since I am still in highschool I don't have much experience, but I 
                have interened at the company Tyrex where I worked with 3d printers and the startup company Choicest Fruit where I 
                learned about software develpment.

        <h2>My Backstory</h2>
        <h5>How I got interested in Software Development</h5>

        <div>
            <img src="./img/scratch.png" id="scratch"/>
        </div>

        <p>When I was in 3rd grade my mom signed me up to a coding class
        for kids because I was interested in doing something afterschool. In the class
        we worked on simple block code on a program called Scratch. Because of this class, I was
        amazed at what I could create using code.</p>
        <p>This is what sparked my interest in software development  </p>
        <br>
        <h2>My Vision and Goals</h2>
        <h5>What I aspire to become in the future</h5>
        
        <div>
            <img src="img/software.jpg" id="software"/>
        </div>
        <p>
            In the future I aspire to become a software develper. I've always found programming 
            interesting and hope to do more of it in the future.
            In addition to this I have always had a passion for dancing, I even
            joined my schools dance team. In the future I would love to still
            dance even if its not part of my career.
